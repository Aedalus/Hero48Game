# Hero48Game

A puzzle game similar to 2048.

Please report bugs to Hero48Game@gmail.com

This was developed using Unity 5.0.1. It should be compatable with newer versions of Unity.
After cloning it, you should be able to open the file location like a regular project.

I've put Hero48 under the MIT license, so you have freedom to do pretty mush anything with the project.
